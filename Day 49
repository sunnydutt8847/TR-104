Workflow triggers

Practice Example: GitHub Actions Config
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Deploy to Vercel
      uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
      with:
        vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
