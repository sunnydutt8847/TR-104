GraphQL Subscriptions

Today's Focus: Real-time GraphQL.
What I Learned:

Subscription setup

Real-time data push

Apollo Client integration

Code:

javascript
const SUBSCRIPTION = gql`
    subscription OnMessageAdded {
        messageAdded {
            id
            content
        }
    }
`;
const { data } = useSubscription(SUBSCRIPTION);
