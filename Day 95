Kubernetes Deployment

Today's Focus: Container orchestration.
What I Learned:

Pods and Services

Deployment YAML

Scaling and updates

Code:

yaml
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
