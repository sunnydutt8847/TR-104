Docker Compose for Full Stack

Today's Focus: Multi-container apps.
What I Learned:

Docker Compose setup

Service linking

Volume management

Code:

yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports: - "3000:80"
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    environment:
      DB_HOST: db
  db:
    image: postgres:14
